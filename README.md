This is a [Tweego](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/) conversion of an [adult Twine game](https://tfgames.site/index.php?module=viewgame&id=2653) made by FloricSpacer, which is in turn based on a CYOA by an anonymous author.

To build:
- install Git and clone this repo
- run `./build.sh` from the command line

If you want to use an already installed version of Tweego, either add it to your shell's `PATH` or set the `TWEEGO` environment variable to its location (including the name of the executable itself). Otherwise, the build script will try to automatically download a version of Tweego suitable for your operating system and use that.
