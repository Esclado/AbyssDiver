:: Cloud Ability
<<nobr>>
<br><br>When you have Cloud with you, he can use his scary-good connections to get you an exclusive loaning arrangement with the shop &mdash; with some stipulations:<br>
<br>
* You can only borrow exactly enough to pay for supplies you want to buy here or companions you want to hire, so you won't be able to carry borrowed dubloons away with you. You may borrow via a note attached to a commerce balloon, too.<br>
* You'll have to pay back 1.2&times; the total value of the dubloons you borrow, rounded down. Any sold Relics will have their value applied to your loan before having any remainder paid to you as dubloons.<br>
* You'll need to be injected with some kind of serum that will only be deactivated upon paying back your loans, and will instantly kill you if you end your journey (by choosing any Habitation option) without paying them back. The shop keeps the exact mechanism secret &mdash; it could be some kind of nanobots or something, but it's hard to say. It's safe to assume they've considered the possibility of you trying to dodge payments by removing or disabling it, so I wouldn't risk it. Taking a commerce balloon with you might be best, to ensure you can still pay if you decide to stay down there.<br>
* Cloud is your guarantor, so if he dies while you have a loan, the serum activates. This isn't as harsh as it sounds &mdash; companions have a much higher survival rate than other divers due to their lack of need for food and water. It shouldn't be a problem if you don't intentionally put him in harm's way.<br>
* Note that Cloud himself cannot be hired with a loan. Other companions can, and they'll get their cut of the payment whether you pay back the shop or not.<br>
<br>
It would go without saying after reading all that, but taking out a loan comes with risks. Loans allow you to have much more freedom to purchase supplies than you would otherwise, but make sure you don't rack up a debt that you can't pay back.<br><br>
<</nobr>>

:: Maru Introduction
Shy, petite, and very soft, he's experienced enough to survive the dangers of the Abyss, but he has no useful skills of note and is fairly weak &mdash; he'd struggle lifting anything much over 5kg. Having a friend down there with you could do wonders for your mental well-being, though.

Likes gardening, cosplay (sews his own outfits), and cooking. He happily identifies as a boy, but grew up wearing feminine clothes, and is most comfortable wearing them, even after having entered adulthood.

<q>H-hi! I'd really like to come with you into the Abyss...I bet there's all kinds of pretty and rare flowers down there, and I'd love to take some home! Oh, and they won't list it as a survival skill for me, but I bet could make every one of your meals down there super tasty, even if all I have to work with are those food rations! Not that the food rations are bad or anything <small>...but...yeah...</small></q>

:: Lily Introduction
Self-described eccentric, everyone-described chatterbox, and insatiable thrillseeker, there's never a dull moment with Lily around. Somehow has the 'purity gene' despite not appearing on any of Outset Town's birth records &mdash; probably has a tragic backstory as some rich guy's illegimate child, or something. (She stubbornly insists it's because she's a pure angel that fell from the sky.)

Likes pop music, traveling (has lost count of how many countries she's been to), and anime. Surprisingly good at haggling; any Relics //you bring up to the surface// (not via commerce balloons) can be sold for 10 dubloons more than their listed price while she's with you. She's stronger than she looks, and has lots of experience carrying heavy luggage around on long trips &mdash; can comfortably carry around up to 25kg.

<q>Heeeey! Ready for our daring adventure right into the belly of the beast, hero? Just stick with me and it'll all work out, don't worry!</q>

:: Khemia Introduction
An adventurer through-and-through, he's been on expeditions into the Abyss well over 50 times, likely the most of anyone alive right now. He's extremely friendly, outspoken, and easy for just about anyone to get along with. Few can match his determination to reach the bottom of the Abyss, or his enthusiasm for uncovering its secrets.

Likes fitness, video games (especially adventure ones), and drinking with friends. Can easily sustain lifting up to 35kg. He's honed his skills with melee weapons to the limit, particularly with swords &mdash; put one in his hands and he's a demon in combat. He knows all the best shortcuts around the Abyss, and has an amazing knack for navigating even unfamiliar areas &mdash; subtract 2 days from //all// travel time costs while exploring the Abyss.

<q>Someday, our drill will pierce through the Abyss and right into hell, and I'm gonna be there when it happens.</q>

:: Cherry Introduction
I think the single best adjective to describe Cherry would be... 'tired.' She has a flat affect, and there's no spark in her eyes when you look at them...it almost feels like she's looking right past you when you talk to her. I'm not sure she should be going into the Abyss &mdash; she only //barely// passed the mental wellness examinations to be hired here, and I get the feeling that she doesn't plan to come back up after her journey with you. She's had a hard, sad life, and I think she's just here to run away from it all. Keep an eye on her and try to cheer her up if you take her with you, okay? Show her that there are still wonderful things to discover in the world. Promise?

Liked photography, writing (she even got published..a long time ago, though), and cats, once. The fates like to toy with her life, and having her with you will make your journey more //luck based:// Cherry's Chaotic Luck will take effect every time you first descend into a new layer of the Abyss, which will give you 50% bonus corruption for random Curses or a 50% discount on random Relics. She also has some surprisingly detailed medical knowledge, and can reduce the duration of any status effects //with a predetermined length// by 1, without having to expend a medkit. She hasn't been eating so well lately, and can only comfortably carry about 15kg.

<q>I'll try not to get in your way down there.</q>

:: Cloud Introduction
An easygoing, smooth-talking handsome devil prone to light mischief at the expense of others...or that's the front he puts up to keep people off their guard, anyways. His relaxed, playful demeanor hides a cunning tactical mind, always carefully planning his next move. He dreams of building a new world, one without borders between countries or people, where nobody goes hungry or gets killed because of who they love...and he thinks the Abyss hides the power he needs to make it a reality.

Likes pranks, strategic games (traditional or digital), and ''revolution''. He has some... special connections? Somehow, he's able to set you up to purchase things from the shop on loans, though with certain conditions attached (Details are provided when you hire him). We've had the leaders of some of the world's most powerful countries come in trying to bend rules like that, and they've been turned away... just who //is// this guy? Anyways, he's also a master marksman, and if you give him a gun, he'll be able to complete any listed task for guns with //2 bullets less// than the stated amount (minimum 1 bullet.) His physical strength is totally average, and he can comfortably carry 20kg.

<q>Well, if I have someone like you with me, this expedition should be a breeze. Between the two of us, I don't think the Abyss stands a chance, do you?</q>

:: Saeko Introduction
A university student working on a PhD on some of the plants native to the Abyss. She approaches the Abyss with a scientific perspective, wanting to understand and categorize the 'magical' effects of Relics and Miasma rigorously and explain the underlying principles &mdash; she really, //really// doesn't like calling it 'magic.' She can be difficult to get to know, and be detached from those around her, single-mindedly focused on her research...but underneath her shell is a level-headed, reliable friend, and a shy, slightly lonely girl. Almost definitely much smarter than you.

Likes reading, learning new languages (fluent in 6 and counting), and tea. Her thorough study of the Abyss gives her the same utility as the Encyclopedia Abyssia, allowing her to easily identify edible flora and fauna in the Abyss. She's extensively studied the effects of Miasma on living organisms, and has several working theories on how to counteract them, allowing you to subtract 5 points from //all// corruption costs. She has the kind of lifting strength you'd expect from a nerd, and will complain //constantly// if you try to make her carry over 12kg.

<q>Ready to go when you are. I hope you know what you're doing.</q>

:: Twin Introduction
Your twin, who you first met after taking the Double Trouble curse on layer 8. <<if $companionTwin.osex=='male'>>He <<else>>She <</if>> thinks you are fake that <<if $companionTwin.osex=='male'>>he <<else>>she <</if>> met after taking the Double Trouble curse <<if $companionTwin.osex=='male'>>himself. <<else>>herself. <</if>>

The rest of the world just sees you as this crazy twin pair who did everything together, shared the same tastes and even went on this journey together. So it appears you have a new companion, who is basically another version of you. Well if you can't trust others, you can always trust yourself, right?
<q>This is so weird, I'm starting to doubt wheter you are the fake or that we are both real...</q>

:: Maru Convo1 Childhood
<<set $companionMaru.affec+=(1+$hsswear)>>\
<<say $mc>>Could you tell me something about your childhood?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>> Well, I was mostly raised by my big sister. She was nice, but not exactly the most gentle person ever. Maybe overprotective would be a better way to describe it. When I was younger I wasn't really allowed to play outside or do anything that might be too rough. Sometimes it was a little annoying, but I understand why she was doing it.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>I can imagine that was a little tough.<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>Yeah, but it wasn't all bad. I think she was just looking out for me, since I am the youngest. We were a very tight family, so we did a lot of stuff with each other. And in a way it forced me to learn to cook and sow as well, since I wanted to do things with my sister.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Is that also the reason why you are wearing feminine clothing? Were they forcing you to do this?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>> No! No, nothing like that. As a child I think I looked pretty feminine.  Well, even more than now I mean. My sisters liked to play dress-up with me, and I actually liked it too. Sometimes I thought that I shouldn't be doing it, but eventually I realized that if it makes me happy, then there's no reason I should stop.<</say>>
He pauses for a moment as he seems to gather his thoughts.

<<say $companionMaru>> Over time I really began to appreciate how well my sisters cared for me. I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but I was glad they accepted what I liked and we could do things together and be happy.<</say>>
You ponder his story for a bit.

<<say $mc>> Thanks for sharing that with me. How are your sisters doing?<</say>>
His expression falls, and he looks down in silence for a few seconds before responding. 

<<say $companionMaru>>They all left.<</say>>
After a few more moments he forces a smile and continues. 

<<say $companionMaru>> Anyway, don't let your meal get cold!<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Oh, sure, thanks for the meal!<</say>>
As you take in the food, you realize it takes shockingly good for something made with such limited ingredients. How did he manage to get the texture just right and the flavors perfectly balanced all the way down here? Maru giggles as he looks at you eating his food.

<<say $companionMaru>> Well, if you like it this much, I'll be sure to make it like this more often!<</say>>

<<say $mc>>I don't really get it. I thought it would be more of a story, but I guess everybody has their strange quirks.<</say>>
Maru looks a bit downward. He opens his mouth as if to say something before closing it again. After a moment he replies.

<<say $mc>>Did I say something wrong?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>> No, no, not at all. I was just a bit suprised that that was your question, since I thought you wanted to ask something about me, but I'm really happy that you like it!<</say>>

Maru smiles widely at your comment.

<<say $companionMaru>> Well, in that case it would be cruel for me to not tell you the recipe! Even if it is made from the limited ingredients we have with us here!<</say>>
Maru tells you in detail how he prepared the dish. It's actually pretty simple, but he added some herbs with subtle flavors which seem to have a made a big difference in the final product. And his cooking method was precise to ensure the texture ended up perfect!

Lily steps forward to approach you, and it almost seems like she's leaning in for a kiss. But before you can react, you suddenly feel a hard pat on your back and open your eyes to see Lily with the widest grin possible on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>But let's not jump the gun here <<mrms>> cassanova. We have a whole adventure ahead of us to get to know each other better.<</say>>
She winks at you once again, though you think there may be a bit more of a suggestive tone this time.

You close your eyes and move your face close to kiss her. But as your face approached hers, your cheeks are suddenly grabbed with suprising strength as Lily pushes you back with an annoyed scoff.

Flustered, you find yourself at a loss for words and don't manage to find a response quickly enough.

You mimic her tone and play along.

<<say $mc>> Ah yes, excellent to hear that miss Lily, what would you say your...<</say>>
Before you can finish your sentence, she interrupts you.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh, and anime too! The best thing is if I can combine both! I once travelled half way around the world for this awesome anime convention. You wouldn't believe the cute little snacks they had over there. Sometimes I wish I could go back, but in my life I prefer to always move forward and not get fixated on the past. Oh, but there was this other time where...<</say>>
In the end Lily rambles on for quite a while about her various travels, what anime see likes, what songs she like, and what anime songs she likes. Even if you can't quite follow all of her stories or don't know much about the places she mentions, she seems happy as long as you make an effort and nod along.

He suddenly cuts you off before you're able to finish your thought.

<<say $companionKhemia>>And once, we were running low on supplies and  everybody thought they were done for. Things were getting really desperate and the main diver was even saying some prayers, like he didn't think we were gonna make it. But I led them through a cave complex I'd known from a previous dive, showed them a shortcut to a nice foraging spot and a quicker path back up to the surface. By the time we were back to the surface we even had a few days of supplies to spare! <</say>>

You pause for a moment, taking stock of where you are. Looking back, you notice that Khemia has picked up a stick and appears to be performing some kind of sword kata. You watch him, fascinated by his movements. The way he darts and spins, always keeping his balance over where he is, or where he's going to be. He flows between forms, dodging imaginary opponents, and apparently dispatching them one after another. The more you watch though, the more you think this isn't just some memorized kata, he's improvising, creating a dynamic scenario in his head, and reacting to it.

He performs an improbable flip in the air, lashing out with the stick, and then driving it down into the dirt on his landing.

He's breathing heavily, but there's no trembling in his motions as he stands and looks over at you. He smirks.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Very well.<</say>>
You're pretty sure he's lost a lot of respect for you.

You give Cherry a firm hug, but you feel her entire body rapidly tense up. You quickly release her, but she still seems a bit surprised from the sudden hug. 

<<say $mc>>I'm so sorry! I only wanted to be friendly! I'm $mc.name, I hope we can be friends. <</say>>

<<say $companionCherry>>Look, I'm sorry if I came across as rude. It's just that... I'm not really that excited to go down, but I'll do what I must.<</say>>

You stand a bit akwardly and wave hello over at her.

You're taking a brief rest, and you see Cherry staring at you, except her eyes aren't focused on you, they're focused a thousand kilometers away. Her expression is held in a sad frown, tinged with pain.

A minute passes, and then Cherry exhales.

<<say $companionCherry>>I had a sister once.<</say>>
A few moments of pause drag out, and then she continues.

You chuckle a bit. Surely your succesful art themed joke will resonate with her!
Cherry's eyes focus on you, and she smiles, briefly. However, her eyes still look haunted.
As you both set off again, her gait isn't exactly energetic. Yet still she walks, with a trudging endurance, bearing a burden that you don't understand.

You give Cloud a firm hug. He seems a bit suprised but keeps his cool and reciprocates, matching your strength.

<<say $companionCloud>>If you really need something then I can make it happen for you, but you'll need to pay it back with interest, so be sure it's worth it.<</say>>
There is no hint of his typical casual suavity in his face, he looks deadly serious.

<<say $companionCloud>>Or maybe you can try one of those surprise hugs on the shopkeeper, and we can see if you'll get enough of a discount to afford everything we need. Ha ha ha!<</say>>
You can't help but crack up a little at the absurdity of the proposal.

<<say $mc>>Ha ha, sure, but you had better not complain about not being special if I can get a discount on my own like that!<</say>>
You spend a few more minutes exchanging casual banter with Cloud before moving on to the other tasks you had to work on.

You give him a firm handshake, and he responds in kind while flashing you a wide, charming smile.

He touches your chin lightly so you look each other in the eyes and smiles.

After an awkward moment, he starts to break out in a grin once again.

<<say $companionCloud>>Ah, I see. Well, if I'm being honest, then the answer is yes, I have.<</say>>
You can't help but hold you breath in anticipation of the story.

This is no place to play pretend and you'll need to be able to recognize your own weakness to be able to survive in the Abyss.

:: Cloud Convo1
As you were walking, Cloud suddenly sprints ahead a few meters and kneels by the side of the road. When you walk over, you see him hunched over a body with multiple injuries which seem to be bullet wounds, or maybe stab wounds?

<<say $mc>> What do you think happened to him? Do you think it could have been the bandits we were warned about earlier?<</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>> Hard to say for sure, but it it were bandits, they were either cruel or simple amateurs, who wouldn't pose a real threat to us.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> What makes you say that? <</say>>
Cloud points to a spot on the back of the corpse.

<<say $companionCloud>> Look, here. He was shot in the back. <</say>>
You see cloud moving the body onto its belly to point at a gunshot wound in the upper back.

<<say $companionCloud>> But it seems off target, if you look at the angle of entry and the trauma around the shoulders, the bullet is probably lodged in there somewhere near the shoulder blades.<</say>>
He then pushes the body onto its back and points at the other wounds.

<<say $companionCloud>> And these are stab wounds, but every single one missed a vital organ. Based on the amount of blood here, my guess is that he bled out in the end after managing to get away at first.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> That sounds pretty gruesome, why would they do that to him? <</say>>

Cloud grins and you simply stare at him in shock.

<<say $companionCloud>> I became quite infamous after stealing the hearts of countless ladies and a few men with my daring escapades. Alas, those days are long gone and now I must work to change things in the world above so that all people can have true freedom, without fear of governments or bandits.<</say>>
He looks up wistfuly and has a big, goofy grin on his face, seemingly not worried about your response. You laugh a bit, but a part of you wonders whether it was truly a joke or if it had a hint of truth within.

You have to be willing to get your hands dirty and do what it takes to get an advantage here. We didn't hurt him and its not like he'll be using the coins any more, right? We might as well make use of anything we can to make sure we survive. With the way the world is right now, that's what you have to do to survive.<</say>>
He opens the pack on the ground, pulls out a few dubloons and tosses them your way.

He pauses and steels his gaze even more

Even the simplest of the Relics or Wonders we will observe in the Abyss simply break the rules that humans have held dear for hundreds of years. We need to rethink everything that we know about the universe. But they do follow their own rules, so they can be scientifically studied.<</say>>
Saeko seems to be getting more invested now, she begins speaking more enthusiastically about Abyssal research.

<<say $companionSaeko>>And while I don't expect to immediately understand why the Abyss does what it does, I think we can at least understand how it works on a surface level. How does Miasma alter developmental processes? How long have the species in the Abyss been evolving? Can we make use of the mutational effects of the miasma intentionally in a controlled manner, perhaps cure medical conditions? The potential is nearly limitless and we need to see what we can learn from it.<</say>>
Saeko continues to talk about recent advances in research regarding the Abyss and the immense potential that the Abyss has, if we could only understand it well enough to use it. You don't get much of a chance to speak, but it is very informative.

:: Saeko Convo0 MysteryTour
<<set $companionSaeko.affec+=(1+$hsswear)>>\
<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm thrilled to delve into all the mysteries the Abyss holds!<</say>>
You see a twinkle in her eyes and the edges of her lips curl upwards.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Me too! I actually have a new theory about the effects of miasma on the flora and fauna native to the Abyss. I hypothesize that while some organisms display the effects of an acute mutation due to miasma exposure, others show an evolution over a long period of time in the Abyss. And I think if we can identify which species have evolved in the Abyss, then we can identify their most recent common ancestor with known surface species. If we do that, we can get a better understanding of what changes long-term colonization of the Abyss had on them and even when the species diverged!<</say>>
She blushes a bit, noticing she may be getting a bit carried away.

<<say $companionSaeko>>But yeah, you might not want to hear all about it. I understand. Suffice to say that I think there is a lot we can learn and I'm quite interested in learning it.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>No, please continue! I don't know if I'll be completely able to understand, but maybe it could be useful for the trip.<</say>>
Saeko smiles widely and perks up at your interest.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Well, if you say so. Anyway, I think that if we can see the common ancestors of Abyssal species to surface species, then we can create bounds on the age of the Abyss. Like if the flairabou of the 4th layer diverged from a surface mammal 500,000 years ago, then we can conclude the Abyss must be at least 500,000 years old. That's just an example, I haven't analyzed the flairabou yet. Though I hypothesize the oldest diverging species may be on the lower levels, so if we don't go deep enough then we won't be able to put an upper bound on the age of the Abyss. <</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>And also, we may be able to learn about how the Abyss alters the evolution of the species within. If we raised a flairabou outside the Abyss, would it have the same properties or does it rely on the miasma of the Abyss to mutate its body in a certain way to stay alive? Do we need to worry about Dune Devouring Borers colonizing the Sahara if someone brought them to the surface? Right now, no one knows, but I think these are important questions to ask and I hope that further analysis of Abyssal flora and fauna can provide answers to these questions.<</say>>
Saeko continues her explanation for a while, posing more questions, hypotheses, and experiments she'd like to do to test them. You can't quite follow everything she says, as she's clearly a better researcher than teacher, but she's glad you're paying attention and tries to explain anything you ask about.

Deeper than layer 5 no one knows much of anything, and in some layers even with knowledge there's no perfectly safe food or water. And, uh, I have stuff for some nice tea if you want some I suppose.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Oh good so we can have some tea without being corrupted in the Abyss. It's good to have comforts like that on a journey like this.<</say>>

<<say $companionSaeko>>Oof. Are you sure this is only half of the equipment? It seems pretty heavy.<</say>>
You nod, but after a minute you hear her once again.

<<say $companionSaeko>> Did you take the weight of this bag into account when dividing the equipment? I think my portion may be too large. It might be more optimal if we moved some of the equipment around...<</say>>
Perhaps you should have just carried it yourself, you thinkn as you end up spending a while sorting through the gear to lighten Saeko's load.

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_sassy_talk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Don't worry, there's not much to be scared of here. The only problem is that some bandits are said to ambush people coming back up from the second layer if you're carrying enough valuables.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_grin.png">> <<say $companionAI>> But just like you, they're a bunch of scaredy cats. If you are in a big group you should be fine. Maybe if you become enormous they won't bother you, even in a small group. <</say>>

They might seem useless by themselves, but their ability to absorb and release heat could be useful if you incorporate them into clothing.<</say>>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>> The final relic I have info on is a bit of an odd one though, the Creepy Doll. It seems people have taken it before. There were groups that said it did absolutely nothing besides looking creepy, but also people who were traveling by themselves who said that the doll kept them safe.

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_plotting.png">> <<say $companionAI>> To be honest, I was only half joking when I said you could take all of them. You need to be careful though, because while they are mild, they will also not give much corruption.<</say>>

	<<say $companionAI>>I mean that you can't cheat the Abyss. If you choose to shrink, and then get rid of the Curse at the Icon of Mercy that's somewhere on this layer, the Abyss will remember and you'll continue to shrink in the future.<</say>>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Anyway as I was saying... Some divers do get random inflictions of curses. So it's very helpfull to get rid of such a unwanted curses. But you could also strategize around using a curse temporary<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Why would I do that?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> It could give you a benifit in exploring the Abyss, not all curses are bad.<</say>>

<</nobr>>

As you open your eyes you feel weird. As if you feel all your memories coming back to you before you are even able to open you eyes. And when your eyes are finally open you still don't see much, as if you are blindfolded. You move your arms to get rid of the blindfold but you can't seem to grab it. You can't even really feel it.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_annoyed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> What the fuck is this shit?<</say>>
Just as you start to wonder how weird your voice sounded you hear a scream very close by . You get the sense you are moved around while at the same time you don't feel anybody moving you. It's all very disorienting.

<<say $mc>> I'm real! I'm real! I'm actually real!<</say>>
Suddenly you feel youself moving even more and light finally streams into your eyes, and you see... yourself??

<<say $mc>> You actually did it! You actually did it! This is amazing, thank you so much!<</say>>
And then it dawns on you

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_mortified.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Ow no... Did I actually switch with you?! I didn't think it would actually work...<</say>>
<<say $mc>> I know, me neither! But I'm so happy you tried! This is going to be awesome.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_shocked.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Ow my fucking... I actually lost my body? I am now reduced to a virtual avatar? What the hell am I going to do? You tricked me into this!<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Slow down sister, I didn't trick you into anything. I just wondered if it was possible and you went ahead yourself and tried it.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_crying.png">> <<say $companionAI>> I don't want this anymore, Ai. I want my body back. You stole my body, give it back.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Wow wow, don't go all panic mode on me okay? I'm not some evil AI that wants to snatch everybodies body and take over the world. I just want to have some fun. So how about we just have some fun today, and then we'll switch back afterwards? Maybe you like all the power that comes with being a high-tech AI and we can do this more often.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_bummed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Okay, maybe it's not so bad to be an AI for a little bit<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_neutral_happy.png">> <<say $companionAI>> I do look pretty cute now!<</say>>
<<say $mc>> You bet your cute little rear of yours that you do!<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>> Yeah let's just enjoy the experience and then change back tonight! Do you need to go in the Fate-Crossing Star pond again or something?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> I don't know, you're the one with the data on the Abyss now.<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>> Ow right! So how do I access this data on the Abyss...<</say>>
The moment you start thinking about the data of the Abyss, you start to remember that the Abyss has a certain origin, exits and nine layers. When you focuss your thought on the layers, you feel yourself remembering the second layer more specifcally. Remembering the second layer in turn floods your head with new memories on the threats, relics, biome, lay-out untill you remember the wonders and start focussing on those, more specifcally the Fate-Crossing Star. You go over all the information you suddenly remembered about it.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_shocked.png">> <<say $companionAI>>... <</say>>
<<say $mc>> Did you access the data?<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>>Yes... It only works once... <</say>>
<<say $mc>> Ow that's inconvinient, I guess you'll be a virtual sister for a bit longer.<</say>>
She giggles.

<<say $mc>> Anyway, where do we need to go to reverse this then?<</say>>
You frantically start going through all the data, layer by layer, all wonders, all curses, all relics but nothing with body swapping properties shows up.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_mortified.png">> <<say $companionAI>>I    can't    find    anything... <</say>>
You start to feel very tired all of a sudden.

<<say $mc>> Wow slow down, you are overclocking the yourself quite a bit. You're draining your battery and if you're not carefull you'll damage your own system!<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_crying.png">> <<say $companionAI>>There has to be a way, there has to be! <</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_clueless.png">> <<say $companionAI>>Wait a second! When you proposed this, you must surely have known a way to reverse this, right Ai? <</say>>
<<say $mc>> Euh not really... You didn't ask about, so I can't remember even looking for that data<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_angry.png">> <<say $companionAI>>What the fuck do you mean I didn't ask about it!? Is this a joke to you<</say>>
Ai seems to frown as well

<<say $mc>> Yeah actually it sort of was. You were the person who took the joke one step further and stepped into a magical pond, remember? I didn't plan for this to happen at all, I don't have access to all the data all the time. I'm high-tech, not some omniscient god. This was not my choice or even what I wanted to happen at all!<</say>>
You calm down and realize Ai is right and you will need her to fix this if this is even fixable at all...
And so a new adventure starts. Although this time you are not the main character anymore but the side kick. You keep shifting through the data and find that in the deepest part of the Abyss there may be a possible solution, but it would be quite the journey to get there. Ai does her best to advance in the Abyss as much as possible, but the Abyss keeps getting thougher to traverse with each layer. 

At first Ai consulted you in which curses she would take on, but more and more she started to take curses on her own accord. Changing your body to that of a pink haired small girl. When you complained about it she brushed you off, telling you that she also needs to feel confortable in her.. your body. As time went on, you felt less and less sure that you would reach the end of the Abyss. Moreover, would Ai even want to change back at that point?
Untill that time the best you can do is brief Ai as much as you can on all the ins and outs of the Abyss and hope her adventure reaches a conclusion you can also live with.

:: Forbidden Grimoire Select
[img[setup.ImagePath+"Relics/forbiddengrimoire.png"]]
A grisly-looking ragged book written in an indecipherable language. Words can only be seen on the page when a person reads it alone, and they vanish as that one person reads them. This will take whatever skills the reader possesses and improve them greatly, leaving a blank, non-useful book behind. Mechanically speaking, if you let a companion use it, it would double the specific numeric benefit of their special ability - Khemia would reduce travel costs by 4 days, Cloud would redduce bullet costs by 4 (minimum 1), Cherry would reduce status effect lengths by2, and so on. (It doesn't really affect, say, Khemia's ability to slay monsters so much - he's already trained to nearly the maximum human limits, and if there's a monster he can't defeat, it's more about the monster simply being durable beyond the human body's limits than it is about any imperfections in his fighting sills.) Using it on yourself could help you in your normal life, but probably not very much on your journey - the benefit would be substantially less than that from using it on a companion, anyways. If one person were to read it twice (such as through Kin Shifter), the second use would have no benefit - best to spread it out among multiple companions.

It's useless once it's been used once of course, so choose wisely who will get the benefit.

Who do you want to give the grimoire to improve their skills?

:: Forbidden Grimoire Maru
While Maru great appreciates your gift and improves the taste of his cooking, you don't gain any material benefit on your journey from giving it to him.

:: Forbidden Grimoire Lily
After reading from the book, Lily's tongue seems just the slightest bit quicker and she sounds more convincing than ever. You now gain 20 extra dubloons when selling Relics with her on the surface.\
<<set $sellAdd += 10>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Khemia
After reading from the book, Khemia's seems to always spot even more efficient routes than before, as if he were intuitively able to tell the best paths through the Abyss. Travel times in the Abyss are now reduced by 4 days instead of 2 while he is with you.\
<<set $timeRed += 2>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Cherry
After reading from the book, Cherry seems to somberly ponder what she read for a few minutes, occasionally looking at her own body as if she were truly seeing it for the first time. The duration of status effects with a predetermined length is now reduced by 2 days instead of 1.\
<<set $statRed += 1>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Cloud
After reading from the book, Cloud lines up his finger with a rock in the distance, mime's a gunshot, then turns to you and smiles. <q>I've got to test out some of the stuff I saw in there, it's crazy stuff.</q> You now have to spend 4 less bullets for any task instead of 2 less.\
<<set $bullRed += 10>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Saeko
After reading from the book, Saeko's looks a bit sad as she turns the last page, as if hoping there was more to learn. After that, she is able to use innovative techniques you've never seen before to minimzie your exposure to the miasma whenever possible. You now subtract 10 from all corruption costs in the Abyss, rather than 5.\

:: Maru Layer 1

<<say $companionMaru>>I love how pretty the flowers are here, and just look at those glowing mushrooms! I bet they're really tasty. Thanks for taking me along, this is fun.<</say>>
Maru spreads his arms and whirls in a circle. It doesn't raise your confidence in his ability to face some of the dangers that are supposedly down here, but you smile in spite of yourself. It's nice to have someone cheerful along on the journey.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 1

<<say $companionLily>>This part of the Abyss is alright, but it's not my favorite. There's just not enough going on. Yes, it's pretty, but it also gets kind of boring unless you brought along a hang-glider or a kayak.<</say>>
Lily looks at you and glances over the equipment you're carrying, sees no evidence that you brought any extreme sport equipment, and then sighs. 

<<say $companionLily>>There might be a couple Relics that are useful to you here, but in general the relics in this part aren't that valuable. I don't know, this layer is just not really my cup of tea. If you want to hang around here, we can, but I'd rather we went somewhere with more going on. Ideally some good music. Do you know the song that goes like...<</say>>
Lily starts humming and occasionally bursts out into full blown singing. This might not be her favorite part of the Abyss, but in spite of that, she seems to be having a good time.	
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 1

Khemia is smiling and nodding as he takes in the landscape around you. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>It feels great to be back down here. This layer is pretty nice. There are some bandits who try to steal Relics from people coming back up, and supplies from people coming down, but they're not so tough. If you brought a weapon, just hand it to me, and I'll take care of them. You'd think they'd get strong stealing Relics from exhausted parties, but you'd be wrong. They're pretty incompetent and I don't think they can ever pick up any of the really strong Relics.<</say>>
Khemia's grin is infectious, and he strides forward, leaping up onto the top of a nearby rock. It's clear he's in his element here.
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 1

<<say $companionCherry>>This place is okay. It reminds me of some things I thought I'd forgotten.<</say>>
Cherry's eyes are focused out in the distance. You decide that now isn't the time to press her on what she meant.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 1

<<say $companionCloud>>There are some people who live down on this layer who seem pretty decent. They've made a town, and are living in harmony. We've got bigger plans and responsibilities though and the real secrets of this place are further down. Let's keep moving.<</say>>
You find yourself marveling at his confident charm. Did you hire him to help with your adventure, or did you just pay him for the privilege of coming along on his?
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 1

<<say $companionSaeko>>The miasma in this layer isn't very dense, but it can concentrate under certain conditions. Some of the water has concentrated miasma in it, and there are some plants and fungi that hyper-accumulate the miasma.<</say>> 
She gestures at a glowing mushroom on the side of the path as she speaks.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Initially I thought it was a defensive mechanism, but that doesn't make sense when most of the organisms in the Abyss can tolerate miasma quite well and even incorporate it into their own life cycles. It's not my primary area of study, but perhaps someday I'll get to do some experiments on it. I'd love to understand why some species accumulate the miasma so much more than others.<</say>>
Then she suddenlt looks a little bit self conscious and starts muttering. 

<<say $companionSaeko>>Errr... sorry, sometimes I can't help myself.<</say>>
Despite her apology it's clear that she's hoping you also care about this stuff.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 2

<<say $companionMaru>>Berries!<</say>>
Maru jumps up and down with excitement at the sight of the small, sweet fruits. He seems to be loving the forest down here, since he's constantly laughing about various plants. This is certainly a grand adventure to him.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 2

<<say $companionLily>>Slippery when wet!<</say>>
 Lily shouts and laughs as she slides down a slick rock. When she lands, she smiles at you. 

 <<say $companionLily>>And down here, absolutely everything is wet.<</say>>
 She casually flicks a drop of water out of your hair, then she steps backwards and does a cartwheel over a large root jutting into the path. Unconcerned that her hands just got covered in mud, she runs them through the vegetation on either side of the narrow path you're following, cleaning them off, mostly. You pause for a second, then ask 
<<if ~($ConvoHandicapSmall || $ConvoHandicapLarge)>>\
	<<say $mc>>Who maintains this path anyway?<</say>>
	She laughs at the question for a moment before she answers. 

	<<say $companionLily>>Maintains? Nobody maintains it. There are a bunch of them down here. They're made by wandering adventurers like us, or maybe the Abyss just makes them on its own, or maybe they're just a bunch of Baying Gourmet trails.<</say>>
	You stop in your tracks, suddenly getting nervous. She looks back at you and rolls her eyes.

	<<say $companionLily>>Oh, they're out there, but there's no point in getting all scared. We're in this together. We'll face what comes, and we shall triumph!<</say>>
	She pumps her fist in the air, and expertly slides down another root, vanishing into a rustle of leaves as the path turns. You're not sure if Lily is one of the bravest people you've ever met, or just one of the craziest. You're glad you're not alone down here though.	
<</if>>\
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 2

<<say $companionKhemia>>When I first started coming down here, I just tried running over all these plants. Ha, I fell on my face a few times when my foot got snagged. There's a trick to it, winding your way through them, lopping off anything blocking the best path forward.<</say>>
He looks towards you and launches into a tale. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>There was one time when a Baying Gourmet jumped one of my party members. An on that dive, the party leader was a cheapskate who hadn't brought along a sword or any other weapons. I got lucky and dodged its claws and somehow was able to jump on its back, but the damn thing took off with me on top of it! I hung on, not wanting it to get loose and turn on me, and managed to ride it for what must have been at least a kilometer, up and down multiple trees, it was a blast. Eventually it just whimpered and laid down in the mud.<</say>>
He smiles broadly, clearly pleased at his impressive escapade.

<<say $companionKhemia>>So I left it there, but when I tracked down the rest of my party, they'd hardly moved at all! Initiative, that's the biggest thing that sets the good explorers apart from the bad ones. So don't get rattled, just do what needs to be done, and if I should get hauled away, do try to come find me.<</say>>
Khemia smirks, and continues leading the way through the thick foliage.	
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 2

<<say $companionCherry>>I like the rain down here. The mist, the plants, all of it... It's peaceful.<</say>>
The forest might strike some people as a bit unnerving, but you're glad that at least Cherry is finding some solace in it.	
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 2

<<say $companionCloud>>I think you might find a Relic on this layer that could enhance your abilities as a leader. There are some who claim that it's better to be feared than loved, but I've never agreed with that precept. If we are to make the world a better place, we must do it through love.<</say>>
The gently falling drops of water seem to bounce off Cloud's hair, and his footing never falters on the wet ground. You can't quite explain how he manages to maintain such calm poise in a jungle like this, but he does, and his presence is reassuring.	
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 2

<<say $companionSaeko>>I love this place.<</say>>
There's a look of eager wonder in Saeko's eyes as she examines the flora around you. The mist and dripping condensation remind you of a phrase you once heard: 'where there is water, there is life'. Saeko certainly seems energized by the quantity of slightly exotic biomass around you. She occasionally stoops down to take a small sample or examine one of the organisms you're passing along the journey. Every now and then she points to an insect, slug, or flower and mentions something about its genus and species or stares in wonder because she doesn't know what it is.

There is something endearing about her passionate curiosity. Sometimes it seems to you that her mind is a place of indexed facts, almost robotic in its logic, but other times the full vitality of a lively brilliance shines through her normally controlled demeanor. It's good she's excited, but you also hope her sample collecting doesn't slow you down too much.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 3

<<say $companionMaru>>You know, these dark caves aren't my favorite place. I always feel like something is going to come out of the darkness and grab me.<</say>>
His normally enthusiastic attitude has turned to muted anxiety. Maybe you shouldn't linger in the darkness of these caves for too long.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 3

<<say $companionLily>>This place is a mixed bag. One the one hand, it's so dark and gloomy that it's sure to drive you bonkers. On the other hand, the echoes are totally sweet.<</say>>
She raises her voice and sings a few notes, making the caverns send the echoes back to you, producing an oscilating set of musical chords that is both beautiful and unnerving. It's also way too loud! You look at her wide-eyed with alarm, not sure what is out there that might have just heard her in the dark. She laughs and pats you on the shoulder.

<<say $companionLily>>Don't worry, you've got me, and I'm sure we'll be fine. Might as well have a bit of fun, or you'll be bonkers in no time.<</say>>
You close your eyes briefly, thinking that the stress of her echoing voice isn't helping much, but then you breathe. Whatever comes will come. It doesn't lessen the dark and oppressive nature of the stone around you, but somehow the exchange makes you feel a little bit better about it. Lily might act carefree, but she knows what she's doing, hopefully.
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 3

<<say $companionKhemia>>They say you can't map the Abyss, and this is true, but if you come down here enough you begin to get a feel for it. You start to recognize things, like the curvature of a particular stalagtite or the patterns of the echoes. I couldn't draw you a map of these caves, but I can help you find your way through them and back out again.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 3

<<say $companionCherry>>It's very dark here. I'm not afraid of the dark or anything, but... the darkness leaves us alone in our thoughts. Stay close, this is not the kind of place we want to get lost or separated.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 3

<<say $companionCloud>>Perception and thought are the key to overcoming most obstacles. The darkness here obscures some helpful things, and some dangerous ones. Staying calm and alert will see us through any of the challenges we face here.<</say>>
Cloud smiles at you, and the darkness feels a bit less oppresive.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 3

<<say $companionSaeko>>The macroscopic biodiversity is lower on this layer of the Abyss, but there are still some thriving fungi, a few animals, and lots of microbes. My knowledge of what is deeper down starts to get pretty scant, but this layer is still fairly well-documented. There are a few protists that I've heard form communities down here and do some fascinating things. If I only could manage to get a sample...<</say>>
She trails off, then nods her head. 

<<say $companionSaeko>>Lead on, I'll be right behind you.<</say>>
She gives you a somewhat nervous smile. You're not entirely reassured, but continue on your way through the seemingly endless caverns.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 4

Maru throws a snowball at you, laughing. 

<<say $companionMaru>>This place is fun!<</say>>
You brush some powdered snow out of your hair, and raise an eyebrow at him. Lately his cooking has been exceptional, but you're surprised how well he's holding up. Then a chill wind whistles through the pass, carrying a sense of foreboding with it. Maru looks around nervously that hurries closer to you, huddling in on himself against the cold. You force yourself to smile at him, despite your own unease and he gives a nervous smile back.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 4

A snowflake lands on a Lily's hair. She responds with an exhasperated half-smile before blowing a jet of air at it. You watch as the snowflake rejoins the wind and floats away. Normally you can't get her to stop talking, but here she's uncharacteristically quiet sometimes. The crunch of your footsteps through the snowy path is strange, like multiple little pops. Lily's thoughts seem to be mirroring your own.

<<say $companionLily>>Do you think any of this snow ever melts? I'd guess not, but if it doesn't, how deep does it go?<</say>>
There's a pause while you both worry about falling down into a 100 meter snowdrift or a hidden crevice in the ice. Then Lily seems to come back to herself, a true smile once again upon her face as she begins chattering and looks up at the icy peaks that tower above you. In this frozen landscape, she's a good friend to have.
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 4

Khemia stands atop a rock jutting out of the snow and ice peering into the distance. A chill wind whips around him, but he seems unfazed.

<<say $companionKhemia>>There's a foe that lurks on this layer that I cannot touch. Almost everything in the Abyss stays on its own layer, but not this one. It doesn't bother those of us with the purity gene, but you are in danger, and neither I nor anyone else can protect you. From here on out, it would be wise not to dither too much.<</say>>
Snow whips around both of you in this barren landscape of rock and ice. Sometimes Khemia is reassuring or awe inspiring, and sometimes he's a bit frightening. His advice is probably sound though, as you do feel like something dark is watching you more intently each day you spend here.
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 4

Cherry trudges along a bit behind you, but the snow doesn't seem to bother her. In fact, she seems to hardly notice the cold. Her breath condenses into small clouds that part around her face. She briefly meets your eyes and gives you a small smile. You're not sure how she conveys so much with a simple expression, but you sense that she's more at peace down here, trudging through the snow, then she has been in some time.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 4

<<say $companionCloud>>The glaciers here tell a story, a tale of countless snows beyond measure. This place has never known the warmth of spring. In some ways it is akin to the world above; harsh, unforgiving, where life is a struggle for most, and even those who aren't struggling are afraid that they might fall, and struggle again. I do not know what force makes this layer of the Abyss the way it is, but my instincts tell me that one who could bring peace and prosperity to a place like this, could also heal the world above.<</say>>
Cloud stares out at the frozen peaks and deep chasms in this frigid place. 

<<say $companionCloud>>Could one with a sufficiently warm heart thaw even this ice, or would the attempt merely freeze their heart? There is power in the cold, but it is not kind, and is ill-suited for bringing joy to anyone.<</say>>
Normally Cloud radiates confidence, but here he seems wistful, or even worried. His reveries are probably not useful to the task at hand though, and after a few more moments he returns to walking. Deep truths will wait for now, there are relics to find and places to go.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 4

<<say $companionSaeko>>Negative fourteen degrees C.<</say>>
Saeko sighs, apparently measuring the temperature once again, as you have seen her do many times while here.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't understand it. No matter where we go in this layer, it's negative fourteen degrees C. It's like there's some giant thermostat carefully maintaining the temperature. Even if I insulate the thermostat, it read negative fourteen degrees C.<</say>>
She shakes her head. 

<<say $companionSaeko>>The algae in these glaciers have processed the miasma in such a way that they make things ingesting them bigger or smaller, but why, and how? Where does the mass even come from? Where does it go?<</say>>
Saeko is apparently frustrated, but then a spark comes into her eyes.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Ah, unrelated, but I have a hypothesis to test. The drifting swallowers on this layer, big floaty things that try to eat you, some previous researchers thought they used hydrogen or helium to keep themselves afloat, but I think it's simpler than that. I think they're just heating the air in the gasseous sacks with their body temperature. I bet they've got blood vessels that contract and expand around those sacks to regulate how buoyant they are by the temperature of the air inside them, and thus how much they expand. It's just like a hot air balloon, only... they try to eat you. There might be a way to use that to our advantage.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 5

<<say $companionMaru>>Flowers and sand!<</say>>
Maru is shouting.

<<say $companionMaru>>Sand and flowers, Flowers and Sand. Everything is flowers and sand.<</say>>
You find yourself agreeing with him. His outburst might not be especially insightful, but you understand his exasperation. At first this flowery sandy desert was a lot of fun to walk through but now it's just tiring. All the flowers start to look the same after a while, and all the petals that blow across the dunes are dry. Every now and then interesting rocky outcroppings peak out of the sand, but for the most part, in spite of the flowers, the terrain is painfully monotonous. Here you are, in the middle of this vast plain of sand beneath a bright "sky" that seems like it shouldn't be there... You're pretty sure you're actually beneath the planet's crust right now, aren't you? What exactly is going on here?
<br>
:: Lily Layer 5

<<say $companionLily>>Okay, I'm officially tired of walking through all this sand. I'm tired of these stupid flowers too.<</say>>
Lily spits out a petal that floated into her mouth as she complains.

<<say $companionLily>>Look, I get it, we've got to keep moving, but seriously we should figure out how to ride one of those Dune Devouring Borers, because they seem like they can move way faster.<</say>>
You give Lily a meaningful look, but she doesn't relent.

<<say $companionLily>>No, I'm serious, it would be fun, and efficient; it's a good idea.<</say>>
You'll have to think about how you might attempt such a thing the next time a Dune Devouring Borer attacks your party, but it doesn't seem like something you'd be able to do easily.
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 5

<<say $companionKhemia>>This is as deep as I've ever gone in past dives. The desert is huge, and often deadly and the Relics are often hidden in trapped passages and tombs. Most explorer parties that venture into the Abyss turn back before this point, and many that make it this far make it back up.<</say>>
Khemia sighs as he looks out at the landscape of unforgiving sands.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I once accompanied a man named Phillip, he was a pretty good leader, but this desert was the death of him.<</say>>
Khemia gives you a very direct look.

<<say $companionKhemia>>The largest part of my job is to try to get you back out of here alive. Make sure you have enough supplies, and if you get hurt, use a medkit. If something goes badly wrong, consider settling rather than dying. This desert has it's own kind of peace, and even though it's not where I'd want to spend the rest of my life, it's better than losing the rest of your life to death."

:: Cherry Layer 5

<<say $companionCherry>>It's too bright here<</say>>
Cherry squints against the light as she complains.

<<say $companionCherry>>That's not even really the sun. Ugh... nevermind, it's not important. Let's just keep going.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 5

<<say $companionCloud>>A trillion petals fly across this desert made of dreams, but now we're far beneath the earth and naught is what it seems. We must swim across this ocean of slow moving waves of sand, to find some precious Relics that can help restore our land. Threats rise up to greet us for they know not why we've come, but none can stand against us beneath this artificial sun.<</say>>
Cloud sighs deeply, breathing in the dry desert air.

<<say $companionCloud>>Sometimes words help us, but not always. This journey has brought us far, let us make it worth the trip.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 5

<<say $companionSaeko>>How are there all these flowers with so little water? Normal flowers are extremely delicate, the petals are turgid with water pressure, the process of pollination and seed development is extremely vulnerable to drought-like conditions, the anthers and stigma require sufficient water for the process to work. These flowers though, they're everywhere, but they don't actually have any reproductive organs on them. They're not doing what flowers are supposed to do. On top of that, they're practically anhydrous.<</say>>
Saeko runs her fingers through her hair as she paces back and forth.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't get it. I've taken careful notes, and the physiology indicates there are at least 17 species of these flowers down here, really just flowers, slender stalks supporting petals with no roots to speak of, and they're clearly reproducing like mad, but there's no water in them, and they're not even engaging in any kind of reproduction I understand. Are they vegetatively propagating? Are the petals themselves a means of tissue separation and dispersal? I've heard there might be a research facility in this vast desert somewhere, have they figured out what's going on here?<</say>>
She seems to mostly be talking to herself, but eventually her eyes lock on yours.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't know how these pseudo-flowers are doing what they're doing, but you and I, we need water. Our cells are full of water, they only work because they're full of water. You're the leader here. Make sure we've got enough water, and for goodness sake, do not let us get eaten by one of those giant worms.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 6

<<say $companionMaru>>No, nonono, I said NO you stupid tentacle!<</say>>
Maru shouts, repeatedly kicking at one of the many tentacles that keeps trying to climb up his skirt. You look back at him with some sympathy. Not far away you can see the river Dycx, and you hear the rumbling of a flock of Omen Eyes. Every now and then you have come across a deep pit that curves down under the land. Even the walls of those pits have been lined in tentacles. Eventually Maru stops attacking the tentacle and rushes to catch up with you.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 6

<<say $companionLily>>Well this is different.<</say>>
Lily speaks with a rye smile on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>I'd heard a couple stories, but I've never actually talked with anyone who's gone this deep before. To think, hell is just full of a bunch of perverted tentacles. It's quite a sight to...<</say>>
She brushes another questing tentacle away from her thigh...

<<say $companionLily>>Feel.<</say>>
She rolls her eyes, then looks into the distance at a great roaring fire that's searing part of the vast tentacle fields a kilometer away.

<<say $companionLily>>Let's also try to avoid getting burned. This place is super weird, but hey, sometimes you've just gotta roll with it.<</say>>
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 6

Khemia has been acting strangely ever since you got here. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>Wow, I still can't believe we've actually made it. I've heard stories, but... I finally got a leader with the ambition and ability to plunge this deep. It's exciting.<</say>>
He grins at you, but then his expression becomes a bit more uncertain.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's also a bit much at first. All the earlier layers I've had experience on, but this place is weirder than I thought it would be.<</say>>
His eyes seem to gain a glint as he looks at the surroundings.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Don't worry though, we've got this. The same skills that brought us this far will see us through whatever we face next. I do think we should be careful about spending too much time here unless we can find some way to deal with these tentacles though. The ones burning with multicolored flames seem pretty sinister.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 6

Cherry looks around skeptically at the endless fields of writhing tentacles, and burning tentacles, and slowly shifting infernos that leave behind only ash. She sighs.

<<say $companionCherry>>Lead the way.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 6

A calculating look comes over Cloud's face as he whispers.

<<say $companionCloud>>Here there be dragons.<</say>>
He glances acorss the landscape and seems to take it in. 

<<say $companionCloud>>It's not enough though. There are powerful Relics here in this disturbing place, but I think we'd need to go deeper. We'll also need to find a way to deal with some of the hexed magic we're already being exposed to. If we don't, the longer we stay here the more it will slow us down, and it will be unpleasant to boot.<</say>>
He gives you a very direct look.

<<say $companionCloud>>Unless you're super fond of tentacles, we need to get back to the surface, and we need to survive the attempt. Don't forget our purpose, and don't underestimate the danger, but I can feel it in my bones that there's something important deeper down.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 6

Saeko shies away from a particularly vigorous tentacle in the path and shakes her head.

<<say $companionSaeko>>This is very weird.<</say>>
You look at her in surprise. Normally Saeko is full of detailed observations and theories, but not today. You ask her what's wrong, and she just shakes her head again.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Look, I don't have an explanation for burning fields of tentacles. I thought the tentacle beasts we saw earlier might have been related to surface cephalopods, but now that seems much less likely. They probably share some common ancestor with these... field tentacles, but I have no idea what that would be. And I really don't like walking around this infernal place that doesn't even have a single plant, but I'll do my best to keep us protected from the effects of the miasma while we're down here. I'm just going to focus on that for right now.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 7

<<say $companionMaru>>I almost like this place, but with all this advanced technology, all they have are the same barely-edible vending machine rations. It's really not much to work with.<</say>>
Maru shakes his head, looking indignant at the cullinary limitations of this city.

<<say $companionMaru>>I'll tell you, robots just don't appreciate good food. Whoever built them must have given up and left out of sheer boredom from eating these same terrible rations day in and day out. There are no mushrooms, no berries, not even a rat. What kind of a city doesn't even have rats?<</say>>
<br>
:: Lily Layer 7

Lily looks quizically at the city around you.

<<say $companionLily>>It just seems silly, you know? Why all these buildings? Why are there these jobs? What are all these robots even doing? Taxes? Taxes in the Abyss? It just seems so ridiculous.<</say>>
You give her a sideways smile, she does have a point, but she's not done... alas, Lily is never, ever done talking.

<<say $companionLily>>Why on earth do robots need houses? Couldn't they all just power down and be content? Now mind you, I've never been a robot, and I don't think I'd want to be one, because being a robot sounds insufferably boring, but if I were a robot, I'd have a hard time rationalizing my programming that was telling me to do all these ridiculous things that make no sense. Move rocks around? Paint stuff? You're a robot, just program yourself to be satisfied with the way things are. Unless... do you think it's the Abyss that's programming them somehow? Wait, I have an idea, we could program them to play music. I don't know how to do that, but it would be super fun. Do you have any Relics that could make all these silly robots sing a song together? No? Ah... that's okay.<</say>>
The monologue never ends...
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 7

Khemia looks a bit shaken.

<<say $companionKhemia>>This place... I've never even imagined anything like this.<</say>>
He looks down at his hands and almost seems to tremble for a moment.

<<say $companionKhemia>>What good is swordsmanship against limitless armies of metal machines?<</say>>
You try to cheer him up a bit, but he just shakes his head.

<<say $companionKhemia>>There's some impressive stuff here, but to me, this all just feels a bit wrong. I thought I knew what the Abyss was about, but the deeper we go, the less sure I am.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 7

<<say $companionCherry>>It's frozen.<</say>>

<<if ~($ConvoHandicapSmall || $ConvoHandicapLarge)>>\
	<<say $mc>>What?<</say>>
<<else>>\
	You try to make clear you don't understand what she means.
<</if>>\

<<say $companionCherry>>This place. It looks alive, but it isn't. All these robots, they move, but they're also frozen. Everything here is waiting, waiting for a day that will never come.<</say>>

Her tone is hollow, but this is more than Cherry usually says. Somehow, deep down, you know that she has spoken a truth.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 7

<<say $companionCloud>>Yes, this is the place. But, where are they? The ones who designed and created this, where have they gone? Their machines still whir about, but... could it be that they are no more?<</say>>
Cloud is unusually agitated, still in command of himself, but not exactly calm.

<<say $companionCloud>>Regardless, the technology here, the power here, this could change the world. Between the Relics on this layer and the ones on the upper layers, it's possible for us to do something big. Let's gather what we can.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 7

<<say $companionSaeko>>To think, this has been down here, all this technology, all this power, and we didn't even know. How long has it been like this? Is this an evolving robotic society, or just... no, it doesn't seem like it. These systems, they lack something vital about them. They're artificial, not organic.<</say>>
You ask her how she knows. She gives you a faint smile.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's just a hypothesis, I don't have the experimental data I'd really need to justify that conclusion, but just look at the robots. They're mass produced, you can tell. Look at how they move. Those movements are a result of programming, not a biological intelligence that's making subtle mistakes and correcting them. Have you ever really watched a colony of ants? Ants are pretty alien to us, their thinking is strange, their movements are strange, but even ants display far more characteristics of life in their actions that any of these robots do. Ant brains are simple, but they still think. It's different from calculation. These robots, none that I've seen seem to be displaying indications of actual thought.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 8

<<say $companionMaru>>I feel like we're at a tea party inside a doll house, but that the person throwing the tea party isn't very nice.<</say>>
You look over at Maru, he's dealing with all of this better than you'd have expected.

<<say $companionMaru>>My sisters used to have tea parties with me when I was young, they taught me how to make crumpets and scones, they gave me lessons on properly preparing the tea, and manners... I really miss them. Being down here, it reminds me of all the fun we had. They were really nice. They weren't perfect or anything, everyone has flaws, but they tried to be nice. I think that whoever is throwing this tea party doesn't understand kindness or love. Still, we're down here together, I'll do my best to make up for what they were missing.<</say>>
<br>
:: Lily Layer 8

<<say $companionLily>>I've got to tell you, when we first came down here I thought that all this crazy space-warping architecture would drive me nuts. However, I'm starting to like it. Oh, don't get me wrong, this place is totally screwed up, creepy puppet things lurking around corners, weird nightmares, endless hallways of rooms that are all just a bit too eerie, but you know, it's also kind of fun. Sure this place is all messed up, but it's our adventure. I've never heard of anyone who actually came down this far before, and as explorers, we're pretty cool.<</say>>
Lily puffs out her chest and strikes a pose of supreme confidence then gets a mischevious grin on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>Do you think that we never hear about people coming this deep because their balloons don't reach the surface, and nobody who comes this deep is able to return alive?<</say>>
Despite her joking tone, you get a slight chill down your spine. This unnerving place has been giving you that impression the whole time you've been on this layer, but Lily laughs.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh relax. We'll get out of here, and then they're going to tell stories about us for ages. The team that cracked the 8th seal, $app.name and Lily, the paladins of doom and their journey beyond time and space. Okay, maybe that's a bit overly dramatic, but we're making history here. Keep your chin up, and stay stylish, we've got this.<</say>>
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 8

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, these doll things that keep following us are easy to take down, but their movements are weird. I wonder how many of them there are in this place, and what they even are. Where do they come from?<</say>>
He's looking a bit more confident than he did back on layer 7, but he's still clearly a bit on edge. He smiles. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's strange, I love exploring, adventure, combat, all this stuff. I'm the most experienced companion in the entire guild, but I feel a little torn about this place now that we're so deep. Since we came down into this labyrinth of stairways and empty rooms, I've had this prickle on the back of my neck. There's something about this place that's very dangerous, and I love it, I love the creepy adventure of it all, but at the same time, I'm not quite sure I can handle it.<</say>>
Khemia peeks his head around a hallway corner, checking for danger.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's like this violin is holding one high note the whole time we're down here, and I can't decide if I'm in love with this layer, or if I hate it. Every time we turn a corner I'm expecting something horrific to happen. Am I going crazy?<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 8

<<say $companionCherry>>Games... do you ever wonder why we play their games?<</say>>
You look at Cherry quizically, and she stares back blankly.

<<say $companionCherry>>I mean it's obvious, right? Everything here is a puppet. Nothing here is entirely real, it's all a game.<</say>>
You still don't understand what she means. She sighs.

<<say $companionCherry>>I just can't help but wonder if we're not puppets too. Is there something out there, pulling on our strings, forcing us to do these things? Nothing down here makes sense, except that.<</say>>
Then she is silent, and just trails along after you as you proceed along yet another uncanny corridor.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 8

Cloud appears somewhat distressed.

<<say $companionCloud>>This place... it should not be.<</say>>
He looks at you intensely.

<<say $companionCloud>>Can't you feel it? There's something very wrong here. These endless stairs to nowhere, these passages, the weird dolls, the food, the water, everything is just... wrong.<</say>>
Part of you isn't sure what he's talking about, because everything in the Abyss has felt kind of wrong to you, though not always in a bad way. Another part of you resonates strongly with what he said though. There is something deeply unnerving about this layer that's different from the ones before it.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 8

<<say $companionSaeko>>Okay, I'm trying not to freak out, but this place is unnerving. Physics isn't working properly here. That in and of itself should be very alarming. The "food" and "water" both seem to have neuro-degenerative effects, which personally terrifies me. And when I look at surfaces through my microscope, do you know what I see?<</say>>
You shake your head, unaware of her observations.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Nothing! No fungal spores, no bacteria, no tiny insects, nothing. I can do my best to keep us protected, but even my best efforts aren't really enough. This place should not exist. We probably shouldn't be here. These animated doll-like things just aren't right. I saw one of them earlier that looked just like you, but it was wrong and I knew it wasn't anything like you. I'm afraid here, and you should be too.<</say>>
<br>
