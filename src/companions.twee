When you have Cloud with you, he can use his scary-good connections to get you an exclusive loaning arrangement with the shop &mdash; with some stipulations:<br>
\<br>
* You can only borrow exactly enough to pay for supplies you want to buy here or companions you want to hire, so you won't be able to carry borrowed dubloons away with you. You may borrow via a note attached to a commerce balloon, too.<br>
* You'll have to pay back 1.2&times; the total value of the dubloons you borrow, rounded down. Any sold Relics will have their value applied to your loan before having any remainder paid to you as dubloons.<br>
* You'll need to be injected with some kind of serum that will only be deactivated upon paying back your loans, and will instantly kill you if you end your journey (by choosing any Habitation option) without paying them back. The shop keeps the exact mechanism secret &mdash; it could be some kind of nanobots or something, but it's hard to say. It's safe to assume they've considered the possibility of you trying to dodge payments by removing or disabling it, so I wouldn't risk it. Taking a commerce balloon with you might be best, to ensure you can still pay if you decide to stay down there.<br>
* Cloud is your guarantor, so if he dies while you have a loan, the serum activates. This isn't as harsh as it sounds &mdash; companions have a much higher survival rate than other divers due to their lack of need for food and water. It shouldn't be a problem if you don't intentionally put him in harm's way.<br>
* Note that Cloud himself cannot be hired with a loan. Other companions can, and they'll get their cut of the payment whether you pay back the shop or not.<br>
\<br>
It would go without saying after reading all that, but taking out a loan comes with risks. Loans allow you to have much more freedom to purchase supplies than you would otherwise, but make sure you don't rack up a debt that you can't pay back.<br><br>

:: Maru Introduction
Shy, petite, and very soft, he's experienced enough to survive the dangers of the Abyss, but he has no useful skills of note and is fairly weak &mdash; he'd struggle lifting anything much over 5kg. Having a friend down there with you could do wonders for your mental well-being, though.

Likes gardening, cosplay (sews his own outfits), and cooking. He happily identifies as a boy, but grew up wearing feminine clothes, and is most comfortable wearing them, even after having entered adulthood.

<q>H-hi! I'd really like to come with you into the Abyss...I bet there's all kinds of pretty and rare flowers down there, and I'd love to take some home! Oh, and they won't list it as a survival skill for me, but I bet could make every one of your meals down there super tasty, even if all I have to work with are those food rations! Not that the food rations are bad or anything <small>...but...yeah...</small></q>

:: Lily Introduction
Self-described eccentric, everyone-described chatterbox, and insatiable thrillseeker, there's never a dull moment with Lily around. Somehow has the 'purity gene' despite not appearing on any of Outset Town's birth records &mdash; probably has a tragic backstory as some rich guy's illegimate child, or something. (She stubbornly insists it's because she's a pure angel that fell from the sky.)

Likes pop music, traveling (has lost count of how many countries she's been to), and anime. Surprisingly good at haggling; any Relics //you bring up to the surface// (not via commerce balloons) can be sold for 10 dubloons more than their listed price while she's with you. She's stronger than she looks, and has lots of experience carrying heavy luggage around on long trips &mdash; can comfortably carry around up to 25kg.

<q>Heeeey! Ready for our daring adventure right into the belly of the beast, hero? Just stick with me and it'll all work out, don't worry!</q>

:: Khemia Introduction
An adventurer through-and-through, he's been on expeditions into the Abyss well over 50 times, likely the most of anyone alive right now. He's extremely friendly, outspoken, and easy for just about anyone to get along with. Few can match his determination to reach the bottom of the Abyss, or his enthusiasm for uncovering its secrets.

Likes fitness, video games (especially adventure ones), and drinking with friends. Can easily sustain lifting up to 35kg. He's honed his skills with melee weapons to the limit, particularly with swords &mdash; put one in his hands and he's a demon in combat. He knows all the best shortcuts around the Abyss, and has an amazing knack for navigating even unfamiliar areas &mdash; subtract 2 days from //all// travel time costs while exploring the Abyss.

<q>Someday, our drill will pierce through the Abyss and right into hell, and I'm gonna be there when it happens.</q>

:: Cherry Introduction
I think the single best adjective to describe Cherry would be... 'tired.' She has a flat affect, and there's no spark in her eyes when you look at them...it almost feels like she's looking right past you when you talk to her. I'm not sure she should be going into the Abyss &mdash; she only //barely// passed the mental wellness examinations to be hired here, and I get the feeling that she doesn't plan to come back up after her journey with you. She's had a hard, sad life, and I think she's just here to run away from it all. Keep an eye on her and try to cheer her up if you take her with you, okay? Show her that there are still wonderful things to discover in the world. Promise?

Liked photography, writing (she even got published..a long time ago, though), and cats, once. The fates like to toy with her life, and having her with you will make your journey more //luck based:// Cherry's Chaotic Luck will take effect every time you first descend into a new layer of the Abyss, which will give you 50% bonus corruption for random Curses or a 50% discount on random Relics. She also has some surprisingly detailed medical knowledge, and can reduce the duration of any status effects //with a predetermined length// by 1, without having to expend a medkit. She hasn't been eating so well lately, and can only comfortably carry about 15kg.

<q>I'll try not to get in your way down there.</q>

:: Cloud Introduction
An easygoing, smooth-talking handsome devil prone to light mischief at the expense of others...or that's the front he puts up to keep people off their guard, anyways. His relaxed, playful demeanor hides a cunning tactical mind, always carefully planning his next move. He dreams of building a new world, one without borders between countries or people, where nobody goes hungry or gets killed because of who they love...and he thinks the Abyss hides the power he needs to make it a reality.

Likes pranks, strategic games (traditional or digital), and ''revolution''. He has some... special connections? Somehow, he's able to set you up to purchase things from the shop on loans, though with certain conditions attached (Details are provided when you hire him). We've had the leaders of some of the world's most powerful countries come in trying to bend rules like that, and they've been turned away... just who //is// this guy? Anyways, he's also a master marksman, and if you give him a gun, he'll be able to complete any listed task for guns with //2 bullets less// than the stated amount (minimum 1 bullet.) His physical strength is totally average, and he can comfortably carry 20kg.

<q>Well, if I have someone like you with me, this expedition should be a breeze. Between the two of us, I don't think the Abyss stands a chance, do you?</q>

:: Saeko Introduction
A university student working on a PhD on some of the plants native to the Abyss. She approaches the Abyss with a scientific perspective, wanting to understand and categorize the 'magical' effects of Relics and Miasma rigorously and explain the underlying principles &mdash; she really, //really// doesn't like calling it 'magic.' She can be difficult to get to know, and be detached from those around her, single-mindedly focused on her research...but underneath her shell is a level-headed, reliable friend, and a shy, slightly lonely girl. Almost definitely much smarter than you.

Likes reading, learning new languages (fluent in 6 and counting), and tea. Her thorough study of the Abyss gives her the same utility as the Encyclopedia Abyssia, allowing her to easily identify edible flora and fauna in the Abyss. She's extensively studied the effects of Miasma on living organisms, and has several working theories on how to counteract them, allowing you to subtract 5 points from //all// corruption costs. She has the kind of lifting strength you'd expect from a nerd, and will complain //constantly// if you try to make her carry over 12kg.

<q>Ready to go when you are. I hope you know what you're doing.</q>

:: Maru Convo1 [noreturn]

<<nobr>>
Maru cheerfully brings you a meal he made, checking to see if it is as satisfying as he hopes it is. <br><br>

<<say $mc>> You know, we're traveling together in one of the most dangerous places in the world, yet I know almost nothing about you. Do you want to tell me anything about yourself?<</say>><br>

<<say $companionMaru>> Well, I'm not the most interesting person in the world. Was there anything you wanted to ask?<</say>><br>

<<if $convoStart>>
[[Could you tell me something about your childhood?|Maru Convo1][$convoStart=0,$choice1=1,$companionMaru.affec+=(1+$hsswear)]]<br>
[[Why do you wear such feminine clothes if you're a guy? It's really weird|Maru Convo1][$convoStart=0,$choice1=2,$companionMaru.affec-=(1-$hsswear)]]<br>
[[What's in this meal? It's really tasty!|Maru Convo1][$convoStart=0,$choice1=3,$companionMaru.affec-=0]]
<<endif>>

<<if $choice1==1>>
<<say $mc>>Could you tell me something about your childhood?<</say>><br>

<<say $companionMaru>> Well, I was mostly raised by my big sister. She was nice, but not exactly the most gentle person ever. Maybe overprotective would be a better way to describe it. When I was younger I wasn't really allowed to play outside or do anything that might be too rough. Sometimes it was a little annoying, but I understand why she was doing it.<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>>I can imagine that was a little tough.<</say>><br>

<<say $companionMaru>>Yeah, but it wasn't all bad. I think she was just looking out for me, since I am the youngest. We were a very tight family, so we did a lot of stuff with each other. And in a way it forced me to learn to cook and sow as well, since I wanted to do things with my sister.<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>> Is that also the reason why you are wearing feminine clothing? Were they forcing you to do this?<</say>><br>

<<say $companionMaru>> No! No, nothing like that. As a child I think I looked pretty feminine.  Well, even more than now I mean. My sisters liked to play dress-up with me, and I actually liked it too. Sometimes I thought that I shouldn't be doing it, but eventually I realized that if it makes me happy, then there's no reason I should stop.<</say>><br>

He pauses for a moment as he seems to gather his thoughts.<br><br>

<<say $companionMaru>> Over time I really began to appreciate how well my sisters cared for me. I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but I was glad they accepted what I liked and we could do things together and be happy.<</say>><br>

You ponder his story for a bit.<br><br>
<<say $mc>> Thanks for sharing that with me. How are your sisters doing?<</say>><br>

His expression falls, and he looks down in silence for a few seconds before responding. <br><br>
<<say $companionMaru>>They all left.<</say>><br>

After a few more moments he forces a smile and continues. <br><br>
<<say $companionMaru>> Anyway, don't let your meal get cold!<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Oh, sure, thanks for the meal!<</say>><br>
As you take in the food, you realize it takes shockingly good for something made with such limited ingredients. How did he manage to get the texture just right and the flavors perfectly balanced all the way down here? Maru giggles as he looks at you eating his food.<br><br>
<<say $companionMaru>> Well, if you like it this much, I'll be sure to make it like this more often!<</say>><br>
Every 10 days, Maru will make a meal with 1 day worth of food that will keep you satisified for 2 days, saving you 1 day of food rations!<br>

<<elseif $choice1==2>>
<<say $mc>>Why do you wear such feminine clothes if you're a guy? It's really weird.<</say>><br>
Maru almost chokes on his food and starts nervously stammering.<br><br>
<<say $companionMaru>> I... I don't know, it just started as a kid and now I just like it I guess.<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>I don't really get it. I thought it would be more of a story, but I guess everybody has their strange quirks.<</say>><br>
Maru looks a bit downward. He opens his mouth as if to say something before closing it again. After a moment he replies.<br>
<<say $companionMaru>> Yeah, I guess so...<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Anyway, as long as you keep cooking these delicious meals, you won't hear me complaining about whatever you want to wear while you cook them!<</say>><br>
<<say $companionMaru>> Well, uh, thanks, I guess.<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Huh?<</say>><br>
Maru looks a bit flustered, as if he wans't sure what to say.<br><br>
<<say $companionMaru>> Thanks for liking the food, I mean! I can make it more often if you'd like!<</say>><br>

Every 10 days, Maru will make a meal with 1 day worth of food that will keep you satisified for 2 days, saving you 1 day of food rations!<br>

<<elseif $choice1==3>>
<<say $mc>> What's in this meal? it's really tasty!<</say>><br>
Maru looks a bit suprised and pauses for a few seconds before answering.<br><br>
<<say $companionMaru>> Uh, thanks, I guess?<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Did I say something wrong?<</say>><br>
<<say $companionMaru>> No, no, not at all. I was just a bit suprised that that was your question, since I thought you wanted to ask something about me, but I'm really happy that you like it!<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Like it? It's absolutely delicious!<</say>><br>
Maru smiles widely at your comment.<br><br>
<<say $companionMaru>> Well, in that case it would be cruel for me to not tell you the recipe! Even if it is made from the limited ingredients we have with us here!<</say>><br>
Maru tells you in detail how he prepared the dish. It's actually pretty simple, but he added some herbs with subtle flavors which seem to have a made a big difference in the final product. And his cooking method was precise to ensure the texture ended up perfect!<br>

Every 10 days, Maru will make a meal with 1 day worth of food that will keep you satisified for 2 days, saving you 1 day of food rations!<br>

<<say $mc>>Hey! Yeah, I'm $mc.name, and I'm so happy that you're joining our team!<</say>><br>
She releases her grip on you and smiles widely. <br><br>
<<say $companionLily>>I didn't expect such a warm welcome, but hey I'm not complaining! Especially from such a cute <<PerceivedGender>>.<</say>><br>

She winks at you and grins as she finishes her comment. You weren't sure if you were going for the cute vibe, but at the very least you want to be taken seriously as an adventurer. On the other hand, you suppose it's good that your new teammate likes you.<br><br>

	<<say $companionLily>>Oh my, we only just met and you already know what to say to get my engine running!<</say>><br>

Lily steps forward to approach you, and it almost seems like she's leaning in for a kiss. But before you can react, you suddenly feel a hard pat on your back and open your eyes to see Lily with the widest grin possible on her face.<br><br>

	<<say $companionLily>>But let's not jump the gun here <<mrms>> cassanova. We have a whole adventure ahead of us to get to know each other better.<</say>><br>

	<<say $companionLily>>Haha! Don't worry about it <<mrms>> hero. I can take pretty good care of myself. But I'll be sure to let you know just in case I find some other damsel in distress you can save.<</say>><br>

She starts snicker at her own joke. You're not quite sure if it's a joke at your expense, but she doesn't seem to clarify. Regardless, she seems to be in good spirits and that's what's important in the end, right?<br><br>

	You close your eyes and move your face close to kiss her. But as your face approached hers, your cheeks are suddenly grabbed with suprising strength as Lily pushes you back with an annoyed scoff.<br><br>

	<<say $companionLily>>There is something to be said about being so forward... But there's also something about not reading signals correctly, right?<</say>><br>

	Flustered, you find yourself at a loss for words and don't manage to find a response quickly enough.<br><br>

	<<say $mc>>I'm so sorry... I just thought that... You know...<</say>><br>

	Lily sighs deeply and her face lightens up a little bit as she raises her eyebrows. <br><br>

	<<say $companionLily>>Yeah, maybe I do know? Well, I guess I am an awfully cute little angel, right?<</say>><br>

	She frames her face between her hands as she gives you a sly smile once again.<br><br>

	<<say $companionLily>>Well thank you for asking <<mrms>> boss <<PerceivedGender>>. My hobbies include listening to pop music and traveling. I've traveled to lots of the countries around this world already! What can I say? I guess I'm just the adventurous type. <</say>><br>

You mimic her tone and play along.<br><br>

	<<say $mc>> Ah yes, excellent to hear that miss Lily, what would you say your...<</say>><br>

Before you can finish your sentence, she interrupts you.<br><br>

	<<say $companionLily>>Oh, and anime too! The best thing is if I can combine both! I once travelled half way around the world for this awesome anime convention. You wouldn't believe the cute little snacks they had over there. Sometimes I wish I could go back, but in my life I prefer to always move forward and not get fixated on the past. Oh, but there was this other time where...<</say>><br>

	In the end Lily rambles on for quite a while about her various travels, what anime see likes, what songs she like, and what anime songs she likes. Even if you can't quite follow all of her stories or don't know much about the places she mentions, she seems happy as long as you make an effort and nod along.<br>

		<<say $companionLily>>So tell me more about yourself. What do you like? Do you do these kinds of expeditions often? I always really love going on new adventures and exploring!<</say>><br>

<<say $companionLily>>Look, it's just that I like to stay in shape so I can keep going on these long adventures. Even when I'm at home I actually work out a lot, you know? And this Relc is great for keeping in tip-top shape!<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>>Oh, sounds like you really keep yourself in shape then!<</say>><br>

<<say $companionLily>>Yeah, I put on some loud music and just work up a good sweat. How else do you think I keep this angelic body?<</say>><br>

She puffs out her chest a bit and gestures widely over her whole body.<br><br>

<<say $companionLily>>Anyway, not to say that this whole journey is not a good workout on its own, buuut... When I saw the World Stone, I started wondering if it could be even better. This could be a golden opportunity to get in better shape than ever before!<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>>Oh, I see! So you want to use it to train?<</say>><br>

	<<say $mc>>Uh, yes, I guess I did.<</say>><br>

After a small, awkward moment of silence your eyes meet and Khemia starts casually laughing.<br><br>

	<<say $companionKhemia>>Hahaha, you sure are one weird little <<PerceivedGender>>, you know that? Just don't goof around too much,  we're still dealing with the Abyss. I've seen things end badly when people get too casual with it. It's pretty easy to think you know what you're doing, but one wrong move in a place you aren't familiar with and kkkksssss.<</say>><br>

He slowly drags his thumb across his neck in an ominous gesture. His expression lightens and he gives a hearty laugh, then pats you on the back with solid thump.<br><br>

	<<say $companionKhemia>>Don't worry too much, but also don't let your guard down. If you're with me, I'm sure things will work out great.<</say>><br>

	He puffs up his chest a little bit and smiles. <br><br>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, I don't mean to brag, but I did almost beat a Dune Devouring Borer once. It was a shame I broke my sword on its rock-hard hide, but I was almost able to subdue it anyway. I swear if I had a stronger weapon then I could have even killed the beast!<</say>><br>

	<<say $mc>> Oh wow, that does sound impressive! I'm really glad we have such a capable person onboard now that...<</say>><br>

	He suddenly cuts you off before you're able to finish your thought.<br><br>

	<<say $companionKhemia>>And once, we were running low on supplies and  everybody thought they were done for. Things were getting really desperate and the main diver was even saying some prayers, like he didn't think we were gonna make it. But I led them through a cave complex I'd known from a previous dive, showed them a shortcut to a nice foraging spot and a quicker path back up to the surface. By the time we were back to the surface we even had a few days of supplies to spare! <</say>><br>

	You listen for a while longer to Khemia's boasting. You actually don't mind it much, as he does seem very enthousiastic and highly capable in the art of Abyssal exploration.<br>

	<<say $mc>>Ha ha, sure, but you had better not complain about not being special if I can get a discount on my own like that!<</say>><br>

:: Cloud Convo1 [noreturn]

<<nobr>>
As you were walking, Cloud suddenly sprints ahead a few meters and kneels by the side of the road. When you walk over, you see him hunched over a body with multiple injuries which seem to be bullet wounds, or maybe stab wounds?<br><br>
<<say $mc>> What do you think happened to him? Do you think it could have been the bandits we were warned about earlier?<</say>><br>
<<say $companionCloud>> Hard to say for sure, but it it were bandits, they were either cruel or simple amateurs, who wouldn't pose a real threat to us.<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>> What makes you say that? <</say>><br>
Cloud points to a spot on the back of the corpse.<br><br>
<<say $companionCloud>> Look, here. He was shot in the back. <</say>>
You see cloud moving the body onto its belly to point at a gunshot wound in the upper back. <br><br>
<<say $companionCloud>> But it seems off target, if you look at the angle of entry and the trauma around the shoulders, the bullet is probably lodged in there somewhere near the shoulder blades.<</say>><br>
He then pushes the body onto its back and points at the other wounds.<br><br>
<<say $companionCloud>> And these are stab wounds, but every single one missed a vital organ. Based on the amount of blood here, my guess is that he bled out in the end after managing to get away at first.<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>> That sounds pretty gruesome, why would they do that to him? <</say>><br>
<<say $companionCloud>> Indeed, it must have been. Check his bag. If my guess is right, we might be able to find something useful. <</say>><br>

<<if $convoStart>>

You follow his instructions and reach into the small backpack besides the pale corpse. Inside, your fingers find the familiar jingle of dubloon coins. <br><br>

<<say $mc>>You were right, he still had his money on him! <</say>><br>
<<say $companionCloud>> So not cruel, just amateurs then, good to know. Okay, put it away and let's move on. <</say>><br>

Cloud will now occasionally find and scavenge a small number of dubloons or bullets for you!<br>

You hunch to check the bag as you speak.<br><br>
<<say $companionCloud>> Of course, I am a notorious former bandit. I'm surprised you didn't know.<</say>><br>
Cloud grins and you simply stare at him in shock.<br><br>
<<say $companionCloud>> I became quite infamous after stealing the hearts of countless ladies and a few men with my daring escapades. Alas, those days are long gone and now I must work to change things in the world above so that all people can have true freedom, without fear of governments or bandits.</say>><br>
He looks up wistfuly and has a big, goofy grin on his face, seemingly not worried about your response. You laugh a bit, but a part of you wonders whether it was truly a joke or if it had a hint of truth within.<br><br>

<<say $companionCloud>> And how long do you think you're going to survive with that attitude, here in the Abyss? You have to be willing to get your hands dirty and do what it takes to get an advantage here. We didn't hurt him and its not like he'll be using the coins any more, right? We might as well make use of anything we can to make sure we survive. With the way the world is right now, that's what you have to do to survive.<</say>><br>
He opens the pack on the ground, pulls out a few dubloons and tosses them your way. <br><br>
<<say $companionCloud>> If you're not careful, you'll end up like this. But maybe, just maybe, we can make the world better in the future.<</say>><br>
Cloud looks up wistfully as if at some unseen dream, but then shakes his head and continues on his way.<br><br>

	<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm excited to discover all the magical wonders the Abyss has in store for us!<</say>><br>

	She cocks an eyebrow as a response.<br><br>
	<<say $companionSaeko>>Magical wonders? You don't seem to understand the gravity of what we will be encountering in the Abyss. It is not that there are simply a series of 'magical' wondrous things that we can enjoy, it is an apparent gap in our understanding of the rules of the universe. Even the simplest of the Relics or Wonders we will observe in the Abyss simply break the rules that humans have held dear for hundreds of years. We need to rethink everything that we know about the universe. But they do follow their own rules, so they can be scientifically studied.<</say>><br>

	Saeko seems to be getting more invested now, she begins speaking more enthusiastically about Abyssal research.<br><br>

	<<say $companionSaeko>>And while I don't expect to immediately understand why the Abyss does what it does, I think we can at least understand how it works on a surface level. How does Miasma alter developmental processes? How long have the species in the Abyss been evolving? Can we make use of the mutational effects of the miasma intentionally in a controlled manner, perhaps cure medical conditions? The potential is nearly limitless and we need to see what we can learn from it.<</say>><br>
	Saeko continues to talk about recent advances in research regarding the Abyss and the immense potential that the Abyss has, if we could only understand it well enough to use it. You don't get much of a chance to speak, but it is very informative.<br>

	<<elseif $choice2==2>>
	<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm thrilled to delve into all the mysteries the Abyss holds!<</say>><br>

	You see a twinkle in her eyes and the edges of her lips curl upwards. <br><br>
	<<say $companionSaeko>>Me too! I actually have a new theory about the effects of miasma on the flora and fauna native to the Abyss. I hypothesize that while some organisms display the effects of an acute mutation due to miasma exposure, others show an evolution over a long period of time in the Abyss. And I think if we can identify which species have evolved in the Abyss, then we can identify their most recent common ancestor with known surface species. If we do that, we can get a better understanding of what changes long-term colonization of the Abyss had on them and even when the species diverged!<</say>><br>
	She blushes a bit, noticing she may be getting a bit carried away.<br><br>
	<<say $companionSaeko>>But yeah, you might not want to hear all about it. I understand. Suffice to say that I think there is a lot we can learn and I'm quite interested in learning it.<</say>><br>
	<<say $mc>>No, please continue! I don't know if I'll be completely able to understand, but maybe it could be useful for the trip.<</say>><br>

	Saeko smiles widely and perks up at your interest.<br><br>

	<<say $companionSaeko>>Well, if you say so. Anyway, I think that if we can see the common ancestors of Abyssal species to surface species, then we can create bounds on the age of the Abyss. Like if the flairabou of the 4th layer diverged from a surface mammal 500,000 years ago, then we can conclude the Abyss must be at least 500,000 years old. That's just an example, I haven't analyzed the flairabou yet. Though I hypothesize the oldest diverging species may be on the lower levels, so if we don't go deep enough then we won't be able to put an upper bound on the age of the Abyss. <</say>><br>

	<<say $companionSaeko>>And also, we may be able to learn about how the Abyss alters the evolution of the species within. If we raised a flairabou outside the Abyss, would it have the same properties or does it rely on the miasma of the Abyss to mutate its body in a certain way to stay alive? Do we need to worry about Dune Devouring Borers colonizing the Sahara if someone brought them to the surface? Right now, no one knows, but I think these are important questions to ask and I hope that further analysis of Abyssal flora and fauna can provide answers to these questions.<</say>><br>
	Saeko continues her explanation for a while, posing more questions, hypotheses, and experiments she'd like to do to test them. You can't quite follow everything she says, as she's clearly a better researcher than teacher, but she's glad you're paying attention and tries to explain anything you ask about.<br><br>

:: Maru Leaving [noreturn]

<<nobr>>
Maru whimpers as tears begin to pour down his face.<br><br>

<<say $companionMaru>>How can you be so mean?! I can't take this anymore!<</say>><br>

Maru storms off, you consider chasing after him, but soon he is out of sight. You see no other option but to continue your expedition without him.<br>

<<for $i = 0; $i < $hiredCompanions.length; $i++>>
	<<if $hiredCompanions[$i].name == 'Maru'>>

:: Lily Leaving [noreturn]

<<nobr>>
Lily looks shocked at your abhorrent actions.<br><br>

<<say $companionLily>>You really went too far this time! I can forgive a lot, but this...<</say>><br>

Lily looks more disappointed than angry, but regardless of her feelings she collects her stuff and leaves you with your thoughts.<br>

<<for $i = 0; $i < $hiredCompanions.length; $i++>>
	<<if $hiredCompanions[$i].name == 'Lily'>>

:: Khemia Leaving [noreturn]

<<nobr>>
Khemia gives you a cold, hard stare, none of his typically casual demeanor is visible.<br><br>

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, <<PerceivedGender2>>, we're done here. I'll find a new group to travel with to the bottom of the Abyss. I don't want to spend another second with a person like you!<</say>><br>

He shoves you aside as he begins to make his way back to the surface by himself.<br>

<<for $i = 0; $i < $hiredCompanions.length; $i++>>
	<<if $hiredCompanions[$i].name == 'Khemia'>>

<</nobr>>
[[Return|$return]]


:: Cherry Leaving [noreturn]

<<nobr>>
Cherry's face contorts as she gives you a look of disgust, uncharacteristic of her typically stoic appearance.<br><br>

<<say $companionCherry>> I honestly thought I didn't care much about anything anymore... But I guess I have to thank you because you made me realize that I do feel very strongly about staying the fuck away from you.<</say>><br>

She starts wandering in a different direction. You try to call out and reason with her, but she simply ignores you and you are forced to give up and watch her leave.<br>

<<for $i = 0; $i < $hiredCompanions.length; $i++>>
	<<if $hiredCompanions[$i].name == 'Cherry'>>
		<<set $hiredCompanions.deleteAt($i)>>

:: Cloud Leaving [noreturn]

<<nobr>>
When you walk back to your tent for the night, you spot a note. It appears to be from Cloud. It simply says "Without trust there can be no loyalty, and without loyalty there can be no true accomplishments". You look around to see if you can find Cloud to discuss the note, but even after searching for an hour he is nowhere to be found. He's gone, you realize, and he won't be coming back.<br>

<<for $i = 0; $i < $hiredCompanions.length; $i++>>
	<<if $hiredCompanions[$i].name == 'Cloud'>>
		<<set $hiredCompanions.deleteAt($i)>>
		<<set $companionCloud.affec=-9>>

<</nobr>>
[[Return|$return]]


:: Saeko Leaving [noreturn]

<<nobr>>
Saeko lets out a long sigh, obviously exasperated with your recent actions.<br><br>

<<say $companionSaeko>>In light of our unproductive collaboration, I feel forced to hand in my resignation from this expedition.<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>> Huh? Why?<</say>><br>

Saeko's face radiates agitation and her eye twitches subtly.<br><br>

<<say $companionSaeko>> What do you mean, why? After all the stunts you've pulled, I'm happy I can simply leave here safely as the same person I was when I entered! I...<</say>><br>

She stops herself and takes a deep breath. <br><br>

<<say $companionSaeko>> Arguing is simply a waste of time at this point. I've made up my mind. I could say I wish you the best of luck, but unfortunately I don't think I do wish that for you.<</say>>

She gathers all her materials and sets out for the surface once again.<br>


<<for $i = 0; $i < $hiredCompanions.length; $i++>>
	<<if $hiredCompanions[$i].name == 'Saeko'>>
