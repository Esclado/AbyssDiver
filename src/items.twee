I'd give you <i>roughly</i> 8 days without food and 2 days without water before death... though you'll probably reach a point where <i>starvation or dehydration heavily disables you and hinders your ability to move and obtain resources</i> in about half that time.<br><br>Of course, eating as little as possible within those limits would be dangerous, too. You should really try to do both daily.",

Some divers have surfaced after a few days of exploring the upper layers, others have spent weeks down there, still not sure if they were even close to the bottom. Some spend months, but carrying that many supplies with you can be difficult for very long expeditions like that, you may need to rely on potentially-dangerous food foraged from the Abyss.",

You can fill it for free whenever you're here in town.<br><br> If you're planning to rely extensively on foraged water, you'll probably want to stock up on several of these so you can have plenty of water stored for emergencies, and buying some cheaper water bottles too might be a good idea, just in case.

The most useful information in it is about the upper layers, and our available information about layers beyond those is still very limited. Mysteriously, all human-edible species in the Abyss contain hyper-adapted bodies, causing them to perish and rot near-instantly after being taken outside of their native layer. (In other words, you cannot extensively <q>farm</q> food in one layer and save it for future layers.)<br><br><i>Taking this with you is strongly recommended if you intend to rely extensively on foraging!</i>",

This, like all of the other available balloons, takes about 2 hours or so to reach the surface for every level you travel down into the abyss. Has a very low capacity, and can't realistically carry anything heavier than a paper message. Nobody will venture down into the Abyss to save you, but maybe you'd like to keep the surface updated, or just let people know that you're alive? Comes with free pen and paper. Single-use.",

After it reaches the surface, a scout from here will find your balloon with your attached order form, dubloons, and any Relics you wish to sell, and will use a pulley to quickly send any items you wish to purchase down to you. The balloon degrades and quickly fails after less than a day, so you should keep it all in a single transaction. Single-use. Should be durable enough to safely transport any Relic you could find in the Abyss. Cannot be used to hire companions.",

desc: "A mini passenger-sized Miasma balloon. The return trip from the Abyss is always longer and harder than the trip down, and hitching a ride on a balloon is much faster, taking hours rather than weeks or days. However, if you want to stop to pick up any kinds of Relics, you would need to cut your balloon flight short, and it's single-use. Pretty much the only thing you're able to do while ascending with your Escape Balloon is accepting Curses and gaining corruption from them. The Escape Balloon has no protection against the Miasma, so while you don't need to spend significant time during your ascent, you <i>do</i> still need to pay the full corruption price for every layer you ascend through.",

Much of the Abyss naturally lit up through complex reactions in the Miasma, but not all of it. Single-use, meaning that after it's lit up, it will serve you for one choice you make, whether it speeds up travel or is required to overcome an obstacle. This does mean that its actual usable time in days can vary a bit, but that's just one of the wonders of stick-based technology.",

They have a special deal where 15 dubloons covers the price of your room for your entire adventure, so you can have a nice place to stop and rest during the 2-day interval you have when returning to the surface, before you have to decide whether to return to the Abyss or call it quits. Otherwise, you'll be sleeping on the ground up here, which isn't fun. Also covers warm meals whenever you're up here, which can be <i>really nice</i> after living off food rations for a long time. Pretty much your only other option for meals while you're up here would be buying food rations (Note: complimentary warm meals would be terribly ineffective food rations in the Abyss, and you're not permitted to take them outside of town anyways.)<br><br>A securely-locked room at the inn would also be helpful as a place to drop off Relics that you don't want to sell, but also don't want to carry around with you in the Abyss.

maxCount: 1,
desc: "The Relics you can find in the Abyss tend to have recognizable shapes, often similar to weapons, tools, or clothing, but the shapes they hold are not terribly strict. So long as a Relic you find remains as the same basic kind of object, it will still function as usual &mdash; so you could, for example, modify a pair of magic slippers into sneakers, or alter their size within normal footwear ranges, or dye them a new color, and they would still retain their magical effects. We have a workshop lined up with an expert team of painters, woodworkers, blacksmiths, welders, tailors, and many others, all well-trained in quickly modifying Relics and ready to shape them to your heart's content. One purchase gets you unlimited assistance from them for your whole journey.<br><br> Aside from the aesthetic benefits, it's worth noting that <i>many</i> Relics of the Abyss have relatively simple and focused effects, which only truly shine when combined with other Relics in interesting ways. You could try to MacGyver your own weapons and Relic-based devices with whatever you find down there, but if you want real, proper workmanship on your inventions, you should take them here. You can send requests up via a commerce balloon, too.",

The effect transfers to those nearby with he <q>purity gene.</q> You can drink as many as you can fit in your stomach if you're trying to cure it fast, but it's probably best to stick to one per day if you're being economical.
